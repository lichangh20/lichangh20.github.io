This is Changhao Li's personal homepage.

## A short introduction
I am a first-year Ph.D. student at Georgia Institute of Technology, advised by [Bo Dai](https://bo-dai.github.io/) and [Chao Zhang](http://chaozhang.org/). Previously, I was an undergraduate student studying at Tsinghua University, majoring in Computer Scienece. I was a member of the [TSAIL](https://ml.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/) group, where I was advised by [Jianfei Chen](https://ml.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~jianfei/) and [Jun Zhu](https://ml.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~jun/index.shtml). 

During my undergraduate years, I have explored the way of accelerating neural network training using 4-bit Quantization, which was published at Neruips 2023 ([paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.11987.pdf)). 

In 2023 summer, I worked with [Woojeong Jin](https://woojeongjin.github.io/) and [Xiang Ren](https://shanzhenren.github.io/) on how to improve the multi-step reasoning qualities using distillation and reinforcement-learning methods. 

In the spring of 2024, I further explored how to train a zero-shot quantized neural network by synthsizing data from a pre-trained model.
