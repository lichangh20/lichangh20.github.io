## Tool Learning with Foundation Models, THUNLP Lab Survey Paper
Background:

* Humans possess an extraordinary ability to create and utilize tools, allowing them to overcome physical limitations and explore new frontiers. With the advent of recent powerful foundation models, artificial intelligence systems have the potential to be equally adept in tool use as humans.
* This paradigm, which is dubbed as tool learning with foundation models, combines the strengths of specialized tools and foundation models to achieve enhanced accuracy, efficiency, and automation in problem-solving.


Contributions:

* We formulate a general tool learning framework: starting from understanding the user instruction, models should learn to decompose a complex task into several subtasks, dynamically adjust their plan through reasoning, and effectively conquer each sub-task by selecting appropriate tools.
* We also discuss how to train models for improved tool-use capabilities and facilitate the generalization in tool learning.
* we experiment with 17 representative tools and show the potential of current foundation models in skillfully utilizing tools.
* We discuss several open problems that require further investigation for tool learning, and hope this survey could inspire future research in integrating tools with foundation models.
